//? Challenge: "Event Maestro: Handle It All!"

//! Objective
//* Create a program using Node.js EventEmitter that:

//? Listens for multiple types of user events (e.g., login, logout, purchase, and profile update).
//? Tracks how many times each event is emitted.
//? Logs a summary of all event occurrences when a special summary event is triggered.

//! Requirements
//? Create at least four custom events (e.g., user-login, user-logout, user-purchase, profile-update).
//? Emit these events multiple times with different arguments (e.g., username, item purchased).
//? Track and store the count of each event type.
//? Define a summary event that logs a detailed report of how many times each event was triggered.
